Poem used to test out rendering of BitmapFonts:
    "Testing the software to see if it works. If it works i will be happy, if it doesn't i'll jump off a bridge."
        - Philip-Nicolas Varga

Code inserted while I wasn't at the computer, by the IT director at Glendon University:
    /**
     * Filo.... I'm watching you.
     *
     * @param whatDoYouWant what do u want
     * @return what i want
     /

    public String filissimo (String whatDoYouWant) {

        if ("".equals (whatDoYouWant)) {
            return "What the?  Say something";
        } else if ("to kill you".equals (whatDoYouWant)) {
            return "go ahead make my day.";
        } else {
            return "Leave me alone... I have work to do.";
        }

    }
